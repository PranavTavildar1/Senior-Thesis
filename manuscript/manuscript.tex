\paragraph{Introduction}
Fossil fuel companies in the United States spends billions of dollars on advertising in order to sway public sentiment on fossil fuels. This has considerable influence on the way which the public views fossil fuels and in turn might affect stock prices.

\paragraph{Conclusion}
This project will require a significant amount of development and expansion before analysis can take place but analyzing the effect of public sentiment on stock prices of fossil fuel companies can provide valuable insight into how public opinion can be used to augment or reduce the effects of climate change.
